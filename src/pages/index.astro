        Hello, I’m Jonathan. I live in Brooklyn, New York with my wonderful
        wife,
        <a href="https://www.amandajbarlow.com" title="Website of Amanda Barlow"
          >Amanda</a
        >. I’m a Software Engineer, most recently employed at <a
          href="https://github.com/jclem"
          title="Jonathan Clem
      GitHub Profile">GitHub</a
        >. I worked on parts of GitHub Copilot, foundational UI work,
        <a
          href="https://github.com/features/actions"
          title="GitHub Actions feature home
      page">Actions</a
        >, and <a
          href="https://github.com/features/issues"
          title="GitHub Issues feature
      home page">Projects</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to GitHub, I worked on infrastructure for <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox_Paper"
          title="Wikipedia article about
      Dropbox Paper">Dropbox Paper</a
        >, where I spent a surprising amount of time focused on web performance
        in the browser. Prior to that, I co-founded a company called Canvas,
        which was a collaborative editor for teams. At Canvas, I learned a great
        deal about building and leading engineering teams, but I also developed
        a strong interest in the technologies that power collaboration software,
        such as operational transformation and conflict-free replicated data
        types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before founding Canvas, my first serious job in the technology industry
        was at
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroku"
          title="Wikpedia article about Heroku">Heroku</a
        >, where I was a member of the web apps team. In particular, I’m proud
        of having lead the drive to rewrite the Heroku Dashboard Rails
        application into a nimbler, faster, Node.js-backend Ember.js-frontend
        application.
